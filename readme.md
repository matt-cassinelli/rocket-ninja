## Design notes

I've tried to use OOP, although some of Phaser 3's methods are not the cleanest to work with.

Where possible, complex code has been seperated into its own classes/files/methods in order to improve readability.

To wrap your head around Phaser-specific things such as *Scenes* I would recommend reading their documentation.

When the code is built, the "parcel-plugin-static-files-copy" script copies files from `./static` into `./dist`.
